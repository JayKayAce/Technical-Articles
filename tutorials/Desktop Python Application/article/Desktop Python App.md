# Building Desktop Applications with Python.

This tutorial will go through the steps of creating an application for a Windows environment, from creating the first python script and ending up with the packaged application. The application we are creating will be an interactive command line interface application, where the user can write tasks future use. With that in mind lets get started. The focus of this tutorial is to avoid requiring the user to have python installed and make sure that the program can be used in any folder. The application will be called **Todo** and give the user the possibility to create todo files in a folder.
